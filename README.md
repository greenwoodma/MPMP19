# MPMP19
My solution to [Matt Parker's Maths Puzzles 19](https://www.think-maths.co.uk/19challenge) which was described as

> "If you square all of the first 19 primes and add them you get a multiple of 19. Enter any number n where the first n primes squared, add to a multiple of n. Any n â‰  1 counts, but bigger is better!"
